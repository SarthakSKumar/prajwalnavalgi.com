## WHO AM I

Ever since I was a kid, I've been fascinated by how things work—taking apart gadgets just to see what's inside. That curiosity led me to the world of **embedded systems,**
where I now bring ideas to life by blending **hardware and software** into **smart, connected devices**.

As an **Embedded Engineer**, I design and develop **IoT products, consumer electronics, and high-performance firmware**—transforming concepts into real-world solutions. From writing optimized embedded code to working hands-on with hardware, I thrive at the intersection of **technology and innovation**.

But my journey doesn't stop at just building things—I love **sharing knowledge** and contributing to the embedded community. "Knowledge increases by sharing but not by saving". Through my [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@ElectronicBuzz/featured), **Electronic Buzz** and **Blogs**, I create content that helps engineers and tech enthusiasts **explore, learn, and grow** in the field of embedded systems.

For me, engineering isn't just about circuits and code—it's about **solving real problems, pushing technological boundaries**, and **creating impactful solutions** that shape the future.

- The best engineers don't just create; they inspire.
